# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Friday, March 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I started my rtlamr data visualization project, which I've unimaginatively 
named rtlamrvis. I've just _barely_ started the data ingestion code.

**Thoughts** I'm very new to Python, and realized today that I know far less about working with 
dictionaries than I thought. Previously, I've coded mostly in Perl, and I keep expecting 
dicts to work the way Perl hashes do. I spent a lot of time spinning my wheels today, trying 
to figure out how to work with nested hashes. Better luck tomorrow, I hope.
